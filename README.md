# BlackList
## Part I - Introduction to threads in JAVA
using Start:
![] (imagenes/thstart1.PNG)
![] (imagenes/thstart2.PNG)
![] (imagenes/thstart3.PNG)  
using Run:
![] (imagenes/thrun1.PNG)
![] (imagenes/thrun2.PNG)
![] (imagenes/thrun3.PNG)  
as we notice when we use run it works secuentially so while Run on thread A is working Run on thread B and C can't start.
on the other hand when we use Start the Thread begin to work normally but he doesnÂ´t block the other ones to start working so Thread B and C can start working
so as we notice on the pictures the threads overlaps.
